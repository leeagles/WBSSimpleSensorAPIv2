# WBSSimpleSensorAPIv2
A demo system for BSc Software Development students to experiment with: Web API takes data from MySQL and delivers it to a controller, which includes a video. The main index file is in sub-directory 'view'.Start there. 
You need a database named smonitor to use this example.
Use the .SQL script to generate the tables and data, if required or simple select the INSERT statements to populate your table with more data.
Run the main page which can be found in wiew/index.php
