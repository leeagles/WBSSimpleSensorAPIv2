# WBSSimpleSensorAPIv2
A demo system for BSc Software Development students to experiment with: Web API takes data from MySQL and delivers it to a controller. The main index file is in sub-directory 'view'. Start there. 
You need a database named smonitor to use this example.You should already have this, but check the field names I've used match yours. You can check using the provided .SQL script. You can also use the .SQL script to generate the tables and data, if required or simply select the INSERT statements to populate your table with more data.
Run the main page which can be found in wiew/index.php
